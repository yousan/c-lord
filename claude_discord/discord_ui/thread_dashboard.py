"""Thread status dashboard — live embed showing all active session states.

Posts and maintains a pinned embed in the main channel that shows which
threads are processing automatically vs. waiting for user input.
When a thread transitions to WAITING_INPUT, the bot mentions the owner
so Discord's notification system surfaces the request immediately.
